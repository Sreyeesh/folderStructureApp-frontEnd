# folderStructureApp-frontEnd
 This python app makes folder strutures for front end developers so they don't have to manually create  index,css, js or other files.

project
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── js
│   └── app.js
└── index.html

If the css, js, index.html, style.css, or app.js files or directories already exist, the script will skip creating them and display a message indicating that they already exist.

To use the script, simply run it using Python.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you need further assistance.
